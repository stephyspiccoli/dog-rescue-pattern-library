The buttons use our primary colour to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is light colour.
- The light buttons are for dark backgrounds.
- The ghost buttons should be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image.
- The header button is to be used only in the navigation tab.
- The banner button is to be used only as a call-to action button on top of the banner.
- The card buttons are for cards only at the adoption page.

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different size of buttons.
